#HeathCare 
###Intro

A little over a year ago I took a Health IT course at Emory University. This course introduced me to the world of Health care and how big of a beast it is. I was browsing Kaggle and I saw that a new data set was posted. I started to take a
look at the data and read more about it. Basically, it contained data for the price of a lot of medical procedures done at hospitals through out the United states. I will play around with this data and see what I can do with it. The link to the information, on Kaggle, is: https://www.kaggle.com/speedoheck/inpatient-hospital-charges.
